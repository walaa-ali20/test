            <p>
                <cite>first step </cite>is to figure out what you want to learn from the subject I have listed below. It depends on your level of the subject.. If you are a beginner and do not know anything about web development I suggest that you start from the beginning of the series gradually, or if you have a background and want to develop this Background just choose from which point you want to start.
            </p>
            <p>
                <cite> second thing</cite> is to choose the time in which you can learn. I recommend that it be two days during the week and two hours during the day .. But in the end, this depends on you and your schedule, so choose the schedule that suits you.

                <h1>HyperText Markup Language</h1>
                <h2><cite>what is HTML :</cite></h2>
                <p>
                    First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                    Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page

                </p>
                <h2><cite>HTML Syntax : </cite></h2>
                <p>
                    HTML documents are composed of textual content and HTML elements.<br>
                    <em>HTML element encompasses </em><br>
                    • the element name within angle brackets (i.e., the tag) and <br>
                    • and also contain attributes.<br>
                    • and  content within the tag.<br>

                    <img src="bloog/elements.png">
                    <br>
                    An empty element does not contain any text content; instead, it is an instruction to the browser to do something.
                    • In XHTML, empty elements had to be terminated by a trailing slash. 
                    • In HTML5, the trailing slash in empty elements is optional.
